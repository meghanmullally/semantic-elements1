  <h1> What are semantic elements? </h1>
<p>
  Semantic elements are elements with a meaning and the word semantics means the study of  words and phrase in a language.
  Semantic elements are important because they help developers and the browsers with clear descriptions. There can be non-semantic and semantic elements.
  For example non-semantic elements would be span, div and p which tells basically nothing as content. While semantic elements would be article, title , main or header which clearly shows its content. Additionally, HTML5 semantic elements work with a various browsers, such as Safari, Firefox, Chrome, and Explorer. Through these semantic elements it can “teach” the past browsers how to deal with “unknown elements.” Lastly, HTML5 has a number of semantic elements used to layout a webpage. A few of these elements are nav , section, summary, details, figcaption, figure, and footer.
